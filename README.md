Exploring computer simulations of natural systems in Processing. This is a little project to get me coding again, while learning some of the techniques in [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net)â€™s excellent [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com).

I was inspired to revisit some of the work from my undergrad thesis project, [Hyperion](https://vimeo.com/959530), exhibited in 2005â€¦ ðŸ˜±

At that time, I was primarily responsible for the sensor hardware and networking side of the project. [Oisin Prendiville](https://twitter.com/prendio2) did most of the creature programming (in Macromedia Flash). I thought Iâ€™d revisit some of the core ideas in this Processing project, as a learning exercise for myself.
